## Introduction

GMAssert is a library containing useful assertions for debugging and automated unit testing. You can use it to alert you to undesirable runtime conditions, pause the debugger at that point for further inspection, or quickly test code for expected behaviour.

## Requirements

- GameMaker Studio 1.4.9999

## Installation
Simply drag GMAssert.gml into your open project and import constants.txt as macros. If you wish to use the debugger, open `__GMA_BREAKPOINT__` and place a breakpoint on the marked line.
